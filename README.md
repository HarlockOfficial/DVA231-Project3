## Project Web-Development

#### Project Idea: Cocktail DB
 - Website for Queries like “Which Cocktail can I make with these ingredients?”
  
 - Login System for Users allows them to:
   - write, edit or remove comments and ratings (1 to 5 stars) about cocktails
   - add, edit or remove personal cocktails (Picture, Ingredients, Description, Recipe)
   - bookmark or unbookmark favourite cocktails
 
 - Login System for Moderators allows them to:
   - act like normal users
   - remove other users comments (and the relative ratings)
   - remove users personal cocktails
   - blacklist a cocktail from the api
   - ban or unban users
   
 - REST API ["The Cocktail DB"](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) for getting Cocktail information
